        <p>Being convincing is hard.</p>
        <p>People (including you and I) are creatures of habit. Getting them to change their ways is deceptively complex.</p>
        <p>The only thing harder than convincing one person?</p>
        <p>Convincing a crowd of people, each with different opinions, experiences, fears, desires, budgets, hopes, and doubts.</p>
        <p>So, in the beginning, sell to one kind of person. The narrower, the better (as long as he or she actually exists).</p>
        <p>This creates faster feedback, makes your first few sales easier, and sets the stage for you to build out your pipeline.</p>
