        <p>There are billions of people on the planet.</p>
        <p>Once we learn to sell, we can convince many of them to give us money, time, attention, and opportunity.</p>
        <p>But there's a caveat: selling, alone, isn't enough.</p>
        <p>Ethical sales requires a high-quality product. When you break your promises, it hurts you in two ways:</p>
        <p>1) Your reputation is weakened.</p>
        <p>2) Before long, people will stop buying, and you'll have to build an entirely new product just to stay afloat.</p>
        <p>Technically, if your market is large enough, you could burn through billions of people with a bad offer...</p>
        <p>But then you'd be a fraud. And no amount of money is worth being a fraud.</p>
        <p>In an ideal world, we wouldn't need to sell.</p>
        <p>We'd just build cool stuff, and grow through referrals.</p>
        <p>So I recommend saving the following concepts for when you already have a great product (yours or an employer's).</p>
        <p>In the beginning, this means you miss out on fast money.</p>
        <p>But often, fast money now = no money later.</p>
