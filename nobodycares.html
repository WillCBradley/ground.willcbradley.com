        <p class="idea-body">Making stuff takes work.</p>

        <p class="idea-body">The more effort you pour into something, the more you want it to succeed.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Like an artist who works on a sculpture for thousands of hours, you learn to see the beauty in your own creation.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">You have the backstory, knowledge, and emotional incentives to admire your own work.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Unfortunately, the market has none of these things.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">It’ll quite gladly chew you up, spit you out, and send you on your way.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">So it’s worth establishing, right from the beginning: Are you trying to make money, or are you building something for its own sake?</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Both are good choices.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">But trying to do both is a recipe for disaster.</p>
