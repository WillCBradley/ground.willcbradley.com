        <p>Making stuff takes work.</p>
        <p>And the more we work on any given project, the more we want it to succeed.</p>
        <p>Like an artist who works on a sculpture for thousands of hours, we learn to see the beauty in our own creations. We're biased by the backstory, knowledge, and emotional incentives at play.</p>
        <p>But the market couldn't care less.</p>
        <p>It’ll quite gladly chew us up, spit us out, and send us on our way without a second thought.</p>
        <p>So it’s worth establishing, right from the beginning: are we building something for its own sake, or to earn the money/approval of others?</p>
        <p>Either can be good choices. But doing <i>both</i> rarely is.</p>
        <p><i>(Note: the rest of these principles assume you're building something for the world, not just for yourself.)</i></p>
