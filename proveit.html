        <p>Steve Jobs didn’t believe in surveys.</p>
        <p>According to him, customers didn’t know what they wanted. If he wanted to innovate, he needed to look elsewhere.</p>
        <p>This approach worked well for Jobs — he built the foundations of a multitrillion-dollar empire…</p>
        <p>But there’s a slight problem: you and I aren’t Steve Jobs.</p>
        <p>And so, if we're trying to survive in any market, we probably need proof of concept.</p>
        <p>With the exception of personal projects, <a target="_blank" href="./nobodycares">our opinions are irrelevant</a>. It’s the customers who count.</p>
        <p>In a business context, cheap ways of collecting expressions of interest include:</p>
        <ul class="tight">
            <li>Email waitlists</li>
            <li>Surveys</li>
            <li>Pre-orders</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Free expressions of interest are good. Paid ones (including "payment" of money, time, or even reputational risk) are better.</p>
        <p>One notable exception to this principle:</p>
        <p>If we know, <a href="./firstprinciples" target="_blank">from first principles</a>, that something will achieve its desired effect, there’s no need for feedback. But if we're going to bet on that, we'd better be sure.</p>
        <p>Next, let's discuss switching costs.</p>
