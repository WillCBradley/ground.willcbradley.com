        <p>If used correctly, these principles make you unstoppable. If used unethically, they make you a fraud.</p>
        <p>1. Urgency</p>
        <p>Time constraints make people act (think: limited-time discounts).</p>
        <p>2. Scarcity</p>
        <p>Quantity constraints drive action, too (think: only 5 items left in stock).</p>
        <p>3. Status</p>
        <p>People like being seen as better than others (think: sports cars, watches etc.).</p>
        <p>4. Loss aversion</p>
        <p>The pain of a loss exceeds the pleasure of an equivalent gain (think: don’t miss out on this 50% off sale).</p>
        <p>5. Social proof</p>
        <p>People like to copy others, especially if those others are credible in their eyes (think: celebrity endorsements).</p>
        <p>6. Reciprocity</p>
        <p>We feel uneasy when we don’t return favours (think: free samples).</p>
        <p>7. Consistency</p>
        <p>We’re inclined to follow through on things we’ve said and done in the past (think: this is why politicians accuse each other of lying).</p>
        <p>8. Liking</p>
        <p>We’re more easily convinced by people we like (think: building rapport on a sales call).</p>
        <p>9. Anchoring</p>
        <p>We judge prices based on other prices we’ve just seen/heard (think: lowball buy offers).</p>
        <p>10. Emotion, Then Logic</p>
        <p>We buy with emotion and justify with logic (think: the salesman lets you sit in the Ferrari, <i>then</i> tells you about the fuel economy).</p>

        <p>Once you start spotting these (and similar) phenomena in daily life, they're hard to unsee.</p>
        <p>In my experience, it's worth spending a disproportionate amount of time learning to do this. Every time I underestimate the importance of it, I get a painful reality check.</p>
