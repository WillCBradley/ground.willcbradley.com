        <p>Advertising a half-baked product gets you a half-baked brand.</p>
        <p>This is why, wherever possible, we iterate based on feedback, and let our creations market themselves (at least in the first instance).</p>
        <p>A distinction worth making: talk is cheap.</p>
        <p>Feedback can take the form of words, but — just like with <a href="./proveit">proof of concept</a> — it's more reliable to follow the expenditure of real assets (time, money, reputation etc).</p>
        <p>Are people buying more? Are they telling their friends? Are they asking what else you sell?</p>
        <p>Only then will you know your product has grown legs.</p>
        <p>And from there, it can start running.</p>
